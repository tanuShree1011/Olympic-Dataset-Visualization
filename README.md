# Olympic-Dataset-Visualization
This is a basic data visualization project that majorly focuses on data analysis to find some key insights like country/ athele with highest number of medals, female v/s male ratio in participation, the country that has the highest number of participants, increase in participation etc. One more key question that this project focused on was whether the host country had any impact on winning medals. The findings suggest that there is a high influence of host country, showing that host countries are expected to win 3 times the medals that they were winning while playing as away.
